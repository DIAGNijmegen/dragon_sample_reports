SUMMARY:
Pathologist: PPan
Date of Receipt: 01/04/2019
Date of Report: 09/04/2019
Type of Material: Bone
Clinical Data:

Material for biobank → No
Method of acquisition biopsy
Clinical data: bronchus malignancy
Question: nature of lesion? Metastasis?
Submission I: 2.5 g, 16 × 16 mm biopsy of the manubrium sterni
Note: This report was electronically generated using a speech recognition system and electronically authorized.

CONCLUSION:
Bone biopsy of the manubrium sterni:

Subcortical bone tissue partially infiltrated by a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Immunoprofile suggests a primary lung carcinoma (TTF-1+).
PD-L1 staining is considered non-representative due to the presence of fewer than 100 tumor cells (3 out of 86 tumor cells positive).
ADDITIONAL NOTE (April 3):

Insufficient tumor cells for mutation analysis.
MACROSCOPY (April 1, 2019):
Freshly received.
Specimen I: Two hard fragments. One fragment measuring 2.5 mm and another fragment measuring 1.0 × 0.2 cm.
A portion of the second fragment was taken for freezing.
Remaining fragments were embedded in cassette 1 and decalcified in EDTA.
Reference: 1b. PPan
MICROSCOPY (April 2):
The fully embedded material contains three larger and multiple very small biopsies (the latter mainly consisting of necrotic bone fragments).
The larger biopsies show cortical and spongy bone trabeculae with focal increased osteoclast activity.
The marrow cavity exhibits edematous and partially desmoplastic stromal changes, with no hematopoiesis.
In multiple areas, tubular formations are observed, composed of atypical cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and nuclear pleomorphism.
Immunohistochemistry:

Tumor cells are positive for CK7 and TTF-1.
CK7 is negative.
PD-L1 (E1L3N, Cell Signaling) shows immunohistochemical membranous staining in 3 out of 86 tumor cells.
ADDITIONAL NOTE (April 4):
Following a request from the treating skeletal specialist for EGFR mutation analysis, the preparations were re-evaluated.
The number of tumor cells is fewer than 200, which is insufficient for mutation analysis.
