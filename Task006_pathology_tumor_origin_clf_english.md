Pathologist: Violet Marinus
Date Received: October 2, 2024
Date of Report: October 4, 2024
Specimen Type: Brain Tissue
Clinical Information: Resected specimen. Suspected intracerebral left parafalcine lung metastasis.
Clinical Question: Nature of the tissue.
Pulmonologist: G. Van Veen (Bethesda)
Material for Biobank: No
Submission: Tumor sample

Note: This report was generated electronically using speech recognition software and has been electronically authorized.

Conclusion:
Excision of clinically suspected tumor, intracerebral left parafalcine region: findings consistent with a metastasis of non-small cell carcinoma, with an immunohistochemical staining pattern indicative of adenocarcinoma with a primary origin in the lung.

Date: October 4, 2024

Supplementary Findings (Lbu):
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry: Positive (>50%).
ALK rearrangement immunohistochemistry: Negative.
For DNA mutation analysis: See T 24-817623.
For fusion gene analysis: See T 24-817631.
Macroscopic Examination:
Date: October 2, 2024

Specimen received: Fresh tissue, fragment for NEOt, followed by formalin fixation.
Macroscopic description:
Irregular, elastic biopsy specimen, partially beige, partially brown.
Maximum dimensions: 2.2 cm × 1.9 cm × 1.6 cm.
One side encapsulated by a thin membrane with an underlying dark blue discoloration.
Sectioned into four slides for further analysis.
Date: October 3, 2024

Fixation: Formalin.
Reference: 3c.
Microscopic Examination:
Brain tissue with a partially viable tumor.
Tumor composed of epithelioid cells arranged in confluent sheets.
Cells exhibit predominantly eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged, occasionally highly pleomorphic nuclei, some with prominent nucleoli.
Focal areas suggestive of glandular formation.
Immunohistochemistry:
Tumor cells stain positive for CK7 and TTF-1.
Additional Findings (Lbu, October 4, 2024):
PD-L1 (22C3 DAKO): Immunohistochemical staining shows membranous, diffuse positivity in approximately 80% of tumor cells.
ALK rearrangement: Immunohistochemically negative.
Supplementary findings were communicated by phone to the treating pulmonologist on October 4, at 13:45.
Accreditation & Quality Control:
The pathology laboratory is accredited under ISO 15189 (RvA_TESTEN_M123).
Molecular analyses are partially conducted at Genome Diagnostics Groningen (ISO 15189 accreditation M321).
Molecular microbiological investigations are outsourced to the Laboratory for Medical Microbiology (ISO 15189 accreditation M456).
Non-accredited tests are explicitly indicated when applicable.
