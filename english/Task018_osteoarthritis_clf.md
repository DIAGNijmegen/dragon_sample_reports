Medical Data:
The patient is experiencing increasing pain in the left hip, with worsening pain while walking, radiating toward the groin. There is a continuous, dull pain on the left side, though lying on it is possible. The patient has a known history of polyarthritis.

X-rays of the pelvis and axial views of both hips were taken.
Comparison was made with the image from November 9, 2021.

Sclerotic changes are visible, along with joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation in the left acetabulum. Additionally, cyst formation is present in the head of the left femur.

The right hip contains a previously placed cemented total hip prosthesis, which remains in an unchanged position with no signs of loosening. Other bone structures exhibit normal contours and bone density. Two calcifications are present in the right thigh. Phleboliths are observed in the lesser pelvis.

Conclusion:
Severe coxarthrosis of the left hip. No changes in the condition of the right hip prosthesis.
