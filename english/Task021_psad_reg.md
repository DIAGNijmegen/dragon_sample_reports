Clinical Data:
PSA: 9.7
No previous TRUS biopsy/biopsies
Clinical stage: T0
Report:
The scan was performed using the detection protocol, including localized prostate T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) in three planes, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging with intravenous Gadovist.

Findings:
Index lesion mark1:

Location: Right apical ventral
Lesion size: 13 × 9 × 7 mm
T2W/DWI/DCE score: 4/4/-
Minimal ADC value: 634 (normal: >950)
Risk category: Intermediate/high-grade cancer (PIRADS v2 category: 4)
Uncertain extraprostatic extension
Impression:
The prostate volume is 68 cc, with a PSA density of 0.14.
The findings are consistent with a significant carcinoma in the right ventral apical region (PIRADS 4), with uncertain extraprostatic extension.
