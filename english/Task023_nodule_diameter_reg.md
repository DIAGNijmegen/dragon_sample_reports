Relevant Medical History:
Status post resection of a sarcoma in the right para-iliac region.
Status post recurrence in the right groin (May 27), status post rectal amputation and stoma (2005).
Clinical question: Pulmonary metastases?

Findings:
A 7-millimeter nodule with central calcification is visible in segment 6 of the left lower lobe (Series 5, Image 456). Radiologically, this is most consistent with a granuloma.
Additionally, there are centrilobular emphysematous changes, particularly apically.
A few small subpleural fibrotic strands are present without further pathological findings.

The major mediastinal vessels follow a normal course.
Mild atherosclerotic changes are noted, with relatively extensive coronary calcifications and some calcifications in the mitral valve annulus.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the mediastinum.
No abnormalities are noted in the axillary region.

As far as the upper abdomen is imaged, the parenchymatous organs appear normal, except for a prominent cyst on the ventral side of the spleen, measuring 38 mm in diameter.
Atherosclerotic changes and degenerative alterations are observed in the visualized osseous structures without further pathological findings.

In the subcutaneous soft tissues, high on the left dorsal side at the level of C6, there is a rounded dense lesion measuring 30 mm in diameter.

Impression:
Intrapulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe with radiological features consistent with a granuloma.
No indications of metastases.
Rounded subcutaneous dense lesion in the soft tissues at the level of C6, left paramedian. Clinical correlation is advised. Possible sebaceous cyst?
