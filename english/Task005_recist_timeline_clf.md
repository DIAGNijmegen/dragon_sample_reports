Addendum End

Clinical Question:
Evaluation compared to CT scan of January 2
Assessment after two cycles of chemotherapy

CT Thorax and Abdomen
Scanned after intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast.
Comparison made with the examination of March 5 and earlier scans.

Report:
CT Thorax and Abdomen with Intravenous Contrast.
For correlation, PET/CT from the same date was used.
For comparison, CT from March 5, 2020, was referenced.

Thorax:
Bilateral axillary conglomerates of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, with a short-axis diameter of 35 mm on the right and 37 mm on the left.
Additionally, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, with two measuring 14 mm at level 4 on the right.
Also noted are bilateral perihilar enlarged lymph nodes and several prominent cervical lymph nodes at the lower cervical region.
Dilated atria, widened pulmonary trunk, and a prominent ascending aorta.
Coronary sclerosis with focal calcified atherosclerosis in the aortic arch.
Scan performed in the expiratory phase, leading to moderate assessability of lung parenchyma.
Bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in the context of bronchopathy, with enhanced interstitial markings and ground-glass opacities.
Pulmonary lesions, predominantly on the right:
Subpleural: 9 mm (9-101)
Perifissural: 6 mm (7-123) and 11 mm (11-159) – most likely lymph nodes
Additionally, unchanged nodules: 5 mm (8-173), 7 mm (11-86), and 9 mm (11-189).
Heterogeneous thyroid gland with a known calcification on the right, but no enlargement.
Abdomen:
Multiple prominent abdominal lymph nodes, including:
Liver hilum: 11 mm (3-86)
Precaval: 16 mm (8-104)
Multiple enlarged inguinal and obturator fossa lymph nodes, with a short-axis diameter of up to 19 mm on the left and 24 mm on the right (4-168).
Previously noted hyperperfusion in segment 6 of the liver.
Slender intrahepatic bile ducts.
Impression of a heterogeneous liver, but suboptimal scan phase for liver evaluation. This could still be due to variable perfusion.
Previously noted dilated common bile duct, possibly related to post-cholecystectomy status.
Symmetric kidney enhancement, with a known cortical retraction on the right (9-193).
Slender collecting system and adrenal glands.
Normal spleen appearance, no splenomegaly.
Induration of the mesenteric fat tissue.
Otherwise, normal appearance of the digestive tract.
Atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
Normal bladder appearance. No free fluid detected.
Skeleton and Soft Tissues:
Degenerative skeletal changes.
No osseous lesions.
Several intracutaneous nodules in the pelvic region.
Impression:
Multiple significantly enlarged lymph nodes throughout the thorax and abdomen, particularly bilaterally axillary and inguinal.
Possible progression of disease in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Authorization Date: June 9
Contrast Agent Used: Optiray 300, 100 cc
