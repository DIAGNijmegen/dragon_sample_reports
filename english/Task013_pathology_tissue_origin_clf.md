SUMMARY:Pathologist: Luigi CascarinoDate Received: July 3Date of Report: July 4Type of Material: Lung

Clinical Information:Indication for request: Progressive consolidation located dorsally against the pleura. History of urothelial carcinoma surgery (2009-2010).Radiologist's Remarks: Metastasis? Primary tumor in the right inferior pulmonary lobe (RIP)? Infiltrate? Other possibilities? Only one biopsy was obtained; post-biopsy pneumothorax possible. Patient needs to be available for discussion at 12:45.

Date of Examination: July 2Time of Examination: Not specifiedSubmitted Material: Lung biopsyLocation: Right lungAcquisition Method: BiopsySide: RightFormalin: Yes

Note: This report was electronically generated using a speech recognition system and has been electronically authorized.

CONCLUSION:Biopsy from the right lower lobe, dorsally against the pleura: localization of an undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry will follow for further subtyping.

July 5: Immunohistochemistry findings do not align with primary lung adenocarcinoma (TTF1-negative) or squamous cell carcinoma. The pattern may be consistent with certain subtypes of urothelial carcinoma, but it does not fully match the ureteral tumor from 2010. p53/CDKN2A mutation analysis is pending to assess the relationship between the primary tumor and possible metastasis.

July 5: Genetic analysis reveals that the tumors in case T12-09539 (lung) and T10-17282 (ureter) have different mutation patterns in TP53 and NRAS. Therefore, these tumors are most likely from different primary sources.

July 7 (Supplementary): The treating physician requested a TSO500 analysis to identify additional driver mutations/amplifications. However, given the presence of an NRAS driver mutation, the Clinical Molecular Biologist in Pathology (KMBP) expects no additional actionable therapy targets, and thus, the analysis will not be conducted.

July 8 (Supplementary - Armond): PD-L1 immunohistochemistry result: positive (>1%, <50%).

MACROSCOPY (July 9):A formalin-fixed, gray-beige needle biopsy measuring 17 mm in length.

MICROSCOPY (July 10):The needle biopsy exhibits a solid aspect, almost entirely occupied by tumor tissue. Some residual alveolar tissue is observed at the edges. There is an extensive desmoplastic stromal reaction with highly atypical cells arranged individually and in clusters. These cells have large, hyperchromatic nuclei with polymorphic features, at times spindle-shaped, at times forming glandular structures or carcinoma fields resembling a urothelial carcinoma (UC). Necrosis is present.

Compared to case T10-17282 (ureter tumor), the polymorphism is more pronounced, though the primary ureteral tumor also exhibited focal severe atypia. Immunohistochemistry follows.

July 9: The tumor cells are positive for CK5,6,14,7, and p53. They are negative for CK20, p63, GATA3, calretinin, D2-40, and TTF1. Although partially overlapping, this pattern differs from the ureter tumor (T10-17282), which was CK5,6,7, CK20, GATA3, and p63 positive. Additionally, p53 is positive in both tumors.

Additional markers:

Positive: p16 (CDKN2A), E-cadherin

Negative: ER, PR, CA19-9, WT1, PAX8, pCEA (Tr. genitalis unlikely)

p53 and CDKN2A mutation analysis is pending to determine primary versus metastatic origin.

July 10 - Laboratory Tumor Genetics Analysis (T11-185147):Determination of clonal relationship via TP53 mutation analysis.

Results and Molecular Interpretation:Analysis was performed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples:

T11-627548 I1 (lung biopsy) with 70% neoplastic cells (verified via EBUS)

T11-857908 I5 (ureter biopsy) with 70% neoplastic cells (verified via EBUS)

Single-molecule Molecular Inversion Probe (smMIP)-based sequencing was performed using the 'Radboud Cancer Hotspot Gene Panel' (version 1.0) and the 'TP53/CDKN2A Gene Panel' (version 1.0) on a NextSeq 500 platform. Mutations with an analytical sensitivity of 1% can be detected. For this sample, the probability of missing mutations with an allele frequency >20% is estimated to be less than 5%.

Findings:

EGFR (NM_005228.3) codons 465-499, 688-823, 849-875: No mutation detected

KRAS (NM_004985.4) codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146: Mutation c.34_35delinsTT (p.(Gly12Phe)); 15% mutant allele

TP53 (NM_000546.5) >91% of coding region: Mutation c.818G>A (p.(Arg273His)); 35% mutant allele

Conclusion:The tumors in cases T12-09539 (lung) and T10-17282 (ureter) have different mutation patterns in TP53 and NRAS. Therefore, they are most likely from distinct primary tumors.

Additional Analysis Details:Using the 'Radboud Cancer Hotspot Gene Panel' (version 1.0), the following genes were analyzed: AKT1, BRAF, CTNNB1, CXCR4, EGFR, ERBB2, EZH2, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, H3F3A, H3F3B, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MPL, MYD88, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, SF3B1, and microsatellite instability markers (BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, NR27).

For this indication, the report includes relevant findings in EGFR and KRAS, along with clinically significant detected mutations for other potential diagnostic considerations.

Authorized by: LGod, July 12

Supplementary (EBUS):PD-L1 (E1L3N, Cell Signaling) immunohistochemistry shows membranous, patchy staining in approximately 30% of tumor cells.
