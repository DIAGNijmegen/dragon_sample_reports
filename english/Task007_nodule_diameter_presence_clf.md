Relevant Medical History: Status post resection of a sarcoma in the right para-iliac region.
Status post recurrence in the right groin (May 27) and status post rectal amputation with stoma (2005).
Clinical Question: Pulmonary metastases?

Report:
In segment 6 of the left lower lobe, a 7-millimeter nodule with central calcification is visible (Series 5, Image 456). Radiologically, this is most consistent with a granuloma. Additionally, there are centrilobular emphysematous changes, particularly in the apical region, along with a few small subpleural fibrous strands without further pathological findings.

The mediastinal course of the major vessels is normal. There are mild atherosclerotic changes, relatively extensive coronary calcifications, and some calcifications in the mitral valve annulus. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the mediastinum. No abnormalities are noted in the axillary region.

As far as visualized, the upper abdomen shows a normal appearance of the parenchymatous organs, except for a prominent cyst on the ventral side of the spleen, measuring 38 mm in diameter. Atherosclerotic changes and degenerative alterations are noted in the depicted bony structures, without further pathological findings.

In the subcutaneous soft tissues, high on the left dorsally at the level of C6, there is a well-defined, rounded density measuring 30 mm in diameter.

Impression:

Intrapulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe with radiological features suggestive of a granuloma.
No evidence of metastases.
Well-defined, rounded subcutaneous density in the soft tissues at the level of C6, left paramedian. Clinical correlation is requested. Possible epidermoid (sebaceous) cyst?
