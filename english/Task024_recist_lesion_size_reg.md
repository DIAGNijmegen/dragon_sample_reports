# Task 24: RECIST lesion size measurement
Label: 40, 32, 14, 18, 22

Notes: the report describes multiple lymph nodes, for which the short axis should be reported: (1) Axillair links 68 x 40 mm → 40, (2) Axillair rechts 58 x 32 mm → 32, (3) Mediastinaal station 4R 27 x 14 mm → 14, (4) Precavaal 29 x 18 mm → 18, (5) Inguinaal links 36 x 22 mm → 22.

Addendum End
Clinical Question:
Evaluation in comparison with CT from January 2
Assessment after two cycles of chemotherapy
CT Thorax & Abdomen
Scanned following intravenous administration of iodine-containing contrast. Comparison was made with the examination from March 5 and earlier scans.

Report:
CT of the thorax and abdomen with intravenous contrast. PET/CT from the same date was used for correlation. CT from March 5, 2020, was used for comparison.

Thorax:
Bilateral axillary conglomerates of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, with a short-axis diameter of 35 mm on the right and 37 mm on the left.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, including two measuring 14 mm at level 4 on the right.
Additionally, bilateral perihilar lymph node enlargement and several prominent lymph nodes in the lower cervical region.
Dilated atria, enlarged pulmonary trunk, and prominent ascending aorta.
Coronary sclerosis.
Focal calcified atherosclerosis in the aortic arch.
Scan performed during the expiratory phase, limiting the assessment of the lung parenchyma.
Bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis associated with bronchopathy, along with enhanced interstitial markings and ground-glass opacities.
Pulmonary lesions, primarily on the right, suspected to be lymph nodes:
Subpleural lesion, 9 mm (9-101)
Perifissural lesions, 6 mm (7-123) and 11 mm (11-159)
Stable nodules: 5 mm (8-173), 7 mm (11-86), and 9 mm (11-189)
Heterogeneous thyroid gland with known calcification on the right, not enlarged.
Abdomen:
Multiple notable abdominal lymph nodes, including:
Liver hilum: 11 mm (3-86)
Precaval: 16 mm (8-104)
Multiple enlarged inguinal and obturator fossa lymph nodes, with a short-axis diameter of up to 19 mm on the left and 24 mm on the right (4-168).
Known hyperperfusion in liver segment 6.
Slender intrahepatic bile ducts.
Heterogeneous appearance of the liver (suboptimal scan phase for liver assessment), possibly due to variable perfusion.
Known dilated common bile duct, possibly post-cholecystectomy.
Symmetric kidney enhancement.
Known cortical retraction on the right (9-193).
Slender collecting system and adrenal glands.
Normal spleen appearance, no splenomegaly.
Mesenteric fat tissue induration.
Otherwise, normal gastrointestinal tract appearance.
Atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
Normal bladder appearance.
No free fluid detected.
Skeleton & Soft Tissues:
Degenerative skeletal changes.
No osseous lesions.
Several intracutaneous nodules in the pelvic region.
Impression:
Multiple (markedly) enlarged lymph nodes throughout the thorax and abdomen, particularly bilateral axillary and inguinal regions.
Findings suggestive of disease progression in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Authorization Date: June 9
Contrast Agent: Optiray 300, 100 cc
