# Task 11: Prostate histopathology significant cancers
Label: 2

Notes: the report describes (1) a lesion in the PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone continuing in the medial transition zone with Gleason score 3+4, (2) a lesion in the PI-RADS 4 lesion in the right transition zone with Gleason score 3+4, (3) a lesion in the random left biopsy with Gleason score 3+4. The lesions (1) and (3) likely come from the same lesion, given the location and size of the PI-RADS 5 lesion (19 x 11 mm).

Examiner: Linda Koe
Microscopic Examination:
Date: December 24
Findings:
Samples I & II: Two tubular prostate tissue biopsies composed of fibromuscular stroma with some preexisting non-atypical glandular structures, as well as diffusely infiltrating atypical glandular structures lined by a single layer of cuboidal-columnar epithelium with mildly enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. One biopsy also shows a focus of cribriform growth. Cytoplasm is partially basophilic. Tumor extends over a length of 11 mm.
Sample III: Tubular prostate tissue biopsy composed of fibromuscular stroma with preexisting glandular structures arranged in an organoid pattern. Some individual glands are closely packed, but focal infiltrative growth is also observed, lined by a single layer of cylindrical epithelium with atypical nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm, similar to samples I/II, extending over 4 mm.
Samples IV & V: Two tubular prostate tissue biopsies with fibromuscular stroma, some preexisting non-atypical glandular structures, and diffusely infiltrating atypical glandular structures lined by a single layer of cuboidal-columnar epithelium with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Growth pattern is predominantly acinar, with focal fusion. Tumor extends over 9 mm.
Samples VI & VII: Two tubular prostate tissue biopsies with fibromuscular stroma and preexisting organoid-arranged glandular structures lined by non-atypical bilayered epithelium. Focal mixed-cell inflammatory infiltrate, primarily lymphocytic. Some glandular structures show nuclear crowding and hyperchromasia but lack prominent nucleoli, insufficient for a high-grade PIN diagnosis.
Sample VIII: Tubular prostate tissue biopsy with fibromuscular stroma and preexisting organoid-arranged glandular structures. Localized extensive mixed-cell inflammation with a neutrophilic component. Basal cell hyperplasia is present in affected glandular structures, but no atypia is noted.
Samples IX & X: Two tubular prostate tissue biopsies with fibromuscular stroma and preexisting organoid-arranged glandular structures with focal basal cell hyperplasia/urothelial metaplasia. One biopsy also contains diffusely infiltrating glandular structures lined by a single layer of cylindrical epithelium with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Predominantly acinar growth, with focal fusion. Tumor extends over 3 mm.
Conclusion:
Samples I–III (PIRADS 5): Adenocarcinoma in all three biopsies, Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, total tumor length 14 mm.
Samples IV & V (PIRADS 4): Adenocarcinoma in both biopsies, Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, total tumor length 9 mm.
Samples VI–VIII (Random right): Chronic active inflammation, no malignancy.
Samples IX & X (Random left): Adenocarcinoma in one of the two biopsies, Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, tumor length 7.5 mm.
Prognostic score (Epstein): Group 2.
Diagnosis:
Prostate adenocarcinoma detected in biopsies from right and left lobes.
