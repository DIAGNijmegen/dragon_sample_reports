Targeted Question: Metastasis?

Report:
Reassessment of CT scan dated March 20, 2006. Hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic body and tail (43 mm) with occlusion of the splenic vein; mesenteric and perigastric collateral vessels; deformation of the portomesenteric confluence with infiltration along the superior mesenteric vein; complete encasement of the celiac trunk and splenic artery with irregular contours; partial encasement of the common hepatic artery; infiltration toward the right aorticorenal plexus. A few small lymph nodes cranial to the celiac trunk (6 mm).

Liver of normal size with multiple cysts. Hypodense lesion in liver segment 5 (32 mm, attenuation 204-236 HU). Degenerative skeletal changes. Thickened bile ducts. Gallbladder appears normal. Adrenal glands appear normal. Normal enhancement and size of the kidneys, with multiple cortical cysts. Arteriosclerosis of the major retroperitoneal vessels. Normal appearance of the urinary bladder. Normal size of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Calcifications in the right vas deferens. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Volume loss in the left lower lung lobe. No pleural effusion or pericardial effusion.

Conclusion:
Hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic body (43 mm) with infiltration into the mesenteric root and encasement of the celiac trunk, common hepatic artery, and splenic artery; extension toward the right aorticorenal plexus. Probable metastasis in liver segment 7 (32 mm).
