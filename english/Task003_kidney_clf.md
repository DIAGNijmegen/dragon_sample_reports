Clinical Data: Status post bilateral nephrectomy. Metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. Evaluation of disease progression?

Findings:
CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed according to protocol with 85 mL of Iomeron 300. Comparison with the examination from May 3 is possible.

No adenopathy in the axillary region; no changes noted.
A previously known significantly enlarged right thyroid lobe with extension into the mediastinum is observed. This causes deviation of the trachea to the left and compression of the trachea. The maximum dimension of the thyroid lobe is currently 43 mm, compared to 35 mm previously.
No increase in pericardial or pleural effusion.
Known enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes remain present. No significant hilar adenopathy.
On lung windows, several pulmonary nodules are visible, consistent with previous examinations and without an increase in size; the largest measures approximately 6 mm in diameter.
Previously identified hypervascular liver lesions have increased in size. Some of these lesions show more necrosis.
Normal findings for the spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder.
No evident adenopathy in the para-aortic, iliac, or inguinal regions.
No significant abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.
No focal skeletal lesions observed on bone windows.
Impression:
Progression of the lesions.
