Clinical Question:
Evaluation compared to CT of January 2
Assessment after two cycles of chemotherapy

CT Thorax and Abdomen
Scanned after intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast.
Comparison made with examination of March 5 and previous scans.

Report:
CT of the thorax and abdomen with intravenous contrast. Correlated with PET/CT from the same date. Compared with the CT of March 5, 2020.

Thorax:
Bilateral axillary conglomerate of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, with short-axis diameters of 35 mm on the right and 37 mm on the left.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, two measuring 14 mm at level 4R.
Enlarged perihilar lymph nodes bilaterally and several prominent low cervical lymph nodes.
Dilated atria, widened pulmonary trunk, and prominent ascending aorta.
Coronary sclerosis. Focal calcified atherosclerosis in the aortic arch.
Scan performed in the expiratory phase, limiting assessment of lung parenchyma.
Bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in bronchopathy with increased interstitial markings and ground-glass opacities.
Pulmonary lesions, particularly on the right:
Subpleural: 9 mm (9-101)
Perifissural: 6 mm (7-123) and 11 mm (11-159), most likely lymph nodes.
Additionally, unchanged nodules of 5 mm (8-173), 7 mm (11-86), and 9 mm (11-189).
Inhomogeneous thyroid gland with known right-sided calcification, not enlarged.
Abdomen:
Multiple prominent abdominal lymph nodes, including:
Liver hilum: 11 mm (3-86)
Precaval: 16 mm (8-104)
Multiple enlarged inguinal and obturator lymph nodes, with short-axis diameters of up to 19 mm on the left and 24 mm on the right (4-168).
Known hyperperfusion in liver segment 6.
Slender intrahepatic bile ducts.
Impression of a heterogeneous liver, but suboptimal scan phase for liver assessment—possibly due to variable perfusion.
Known dilated common bile duct, possibly post-cholecystectomy?
Symmetric contrast enhancement of the kidneys.
Known cortical retraction in the right kidney (9-193).
Slender collecting system. Slender adrenal glands.
Normal spleen appearance. No splenomegaly.
Induration of mesenteric fat tissue.
Otherwise normal appearance of the digestive tract.
Atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
Normal bladder appearance. No free fluid.
Skeleton and Soft Tissues:
Degenerative changes in the skeleton.
No osseous lesions.
Several intracutaneous nodules in the pelvic region.
Impression:
Multiple (severely) enlarged lymph nodes throughout the thorax and abdomen, particularly in bilateral axillary and inguinal regions. Findings may suggest disease progression in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
